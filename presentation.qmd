# Understanding the Dataset

# 

-   It is a combination of about 890 characters from 100 different universes across pop culture, media and entertainment.
-   The dataset is a compilation of the results of several personality tests taken by different users.
-   It consists of a total of 400 different personality questions out of which, the most commonly occurring ones have been categorized into groups.

## 

-   The whole dataset consists of three DataFrames:
    -   "character": Includes high level information including a notability score about each character.
    -   "psych_stats": Consist data on personality/psychometric stats per character.
    -   "myers_briggs": Test users self-identified their Myers-Briggs types.

## Question 1:

‎

How do Myers-Briggs personality types distribute across different universes, and how does the average match percentage vary within each universe? Additionally, is there any correlation between character notability scores and their Myers-Briggs types within each universe?

# Plot 1

The number of characters that hold the highest correlation to a respective Myers-Briggs personality type:

# Insights

-   The plot highlights the vast differences between Myers-Briggs personality type occurrences in different universes.
-   To exemplify, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" has a larger amount of introverted characters than extroverted which contrasts with "Downton Abbey" which appears to contain more extroverted characters than introverted.
-   This could allow for inferences concerning whether specific genres of media are inherently built with introverted or extroverted characters (i.e. action should presumably comprise of more extroverts).

# Insights

## Question 2:

‎

What is the frequency distribution of character personality traits across all characters, and how does it correlate with their average rating? Furthermore, do character notability scores vary significantly based on their personality traits?

## Question 2 - Part 1

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Plot A

![ ](images/question2Part1Plot1.png){width="850"}

#### Plot B

![ ](images/question2Part1Plot2.png){width="850"}

#### Insights

- Different personality traits have been classified into different groups.
- The frequency distribution of characters across multiple universes have been plotted along with their average rating from a score out of 100.
- Regardless of the type of personality traits, the average rating remains similar.
- After looking into the data, it seems that there is no correlation between frequency distribution and average rating.

## Question 2 - Part 1

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Plot C

![ ](images/question2Part1Plot3.png){width="850"}

#### Insights

- This plot shows the distribution of average rating of different groups of personality.
- While every group is zero skewed, only 'balanced' and 'other' traits are right skewed.

## Question 2 - Part 2

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Plot

![ ](images/question2Part2Plot1.png){width="850"}

#### Insights
From the plot it is clear that there are very insignificant differences in the average notability score across the personality groups of different characters.

# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::

[^1]: And add footnotes

-   like

-   this

## Code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model <- lm(mpg ~ speed, data = mtcars) 

model |> tidy()

model |> glance()

```

## Plots

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(species = ifelse(species == "Adelie", "Adelie", "Other")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
