# Psychometric Analysis

## INFO 526- Fall 2023- Project 1

## Understanding the Dataset

-   It is a combination of about 890 characters from 100 different universes across pop culture, media and entertainment.
-   The dataset is a compilation of the results of several personality tests taken by different users.
-   It consists of a total of 400 different personality questions out of which, the most commonly occurring ones have been categorized into groups.

## 

-   The whole dataset consists of three DataFrames:
    -   "character": Includes high level information including a notability score about each character.
    -   "psych_stats": Consist data on personality/psychometric stats per character.
    -   "myers_briggs": Test users self-identified their Myers-Briggs types.

## Question 1:

‎

How do Myers-Briggs personality types distribute across different universes, and how does the average match percentage vary within each universe? Additionally, is there any correlation between character notability scores and their Myers-Briggs types within each universe?

## Question 2:

‎

What is the frequency distribution of character personality traits across all characters, and how does it correlate with their average rating? Furthermore, do character notability scores vary significantly based on their personality traits?

# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::

[^1]: And add footnotes

-   like

-   this

## Code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model <- lm(mpg ~ speed, data = mtcars) 

model |> tidy()

model |> glance()

```

## Plots

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(species = ifelse(species == "Adelie", "Adelie", "Other")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5.5}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(linewidth = 0.75,
               outlier.size = 2.5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "cm"))
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
