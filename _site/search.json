It also consists of statistical data of the percentage of people that have matched with them as well as their Myers Briggs personality type that they self-identified with."

    "text": "Choosing this dataset\nWe chose this dataset because it would be more interesting to work on and visualize data that we can understand easily, are familiar with and can even relate to some of it. * Also, the topic on which this dataset is based is very engaging and we reckon it would attract more people to be interested in it. * Since quite a number of fictional characters from different universes are used, it expands our dataset and adds more diversity to it, letting us make different types of plots to visualize the characters, their traits and the number of people that identify with them. Moreover, since fictional characters are not bound by real-world constraints, we have more freedom to explore unconventional or extreme personality traits specially (in our case) to use it for data analysis in an engaging and accessible way. * Using data based on fictional characters that represent personality types and personality traits is a unique way to portray what we have learnt about data visualization so far. Fusing our ‘after-study’ forms of entertainment with our academic subjects will make working on this project more interesting."
